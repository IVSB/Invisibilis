# Invisibilis
Invisibilis will be the last "Privacy-coin" created.

Now I say this to say that it will be the last because it will be the best, gain the most popularity, and make all of other Privacy-based coins obsolete. First there was DarkSend (now PrivateSend) with DarkCoin (now DASH) enabling for the first true, decentrailized way of esuring private transactions. Now this was not flawless, but it definitely made it a whole hell of a lot harder for the Blockchain analysts to see information about and track people's private transactions.

DASH is still a good stable coin that has a unique and still very useful feature of sending your coins privately through PrivateSend, which esentially mixes your coins with other people's coins then you have ready "Untraceable" fund to send. Increasing the "Untraceableness" each time funds are moved. This idea sparked on a lot of the ideas we see now in the most modern Privacy based currency such as Monero, which was forked off of Bytecoin and improved becoming the most popular, most private, and most stable "Privacy-coin".

Now the Monero Community is growing and development is increasing at a very quick rate, but we have decided to make an ever better Monero called Invisibilis.

# Our Startup Goals

Unlike how Monero's startup goals included fixing many errors or inefficiencies in the code and fixing several flaws, our start-up goals are to create something new. Not just improve the already very stable coin of Monero, but to create a better, more invisible way of transfering funds.

We hope to add many new features, such as adapting DigiNote's Encrypted Private Messaging idea. Other ideas include addapting concepts from the Tor Network to allow for future applications that operate complete invisible, a blockchain that is computationally unreadable, yet perfectly functional, secure, and stable.

Like said before, we don't plan to improve Monero, we plan to create Invisibilis. Invisibilis will be recreated by some of the best coders that will all remain Invisible.

We plan for everything about this coin to be decentrialized, private, and invisible. For this reason, we're not going to have a "main page" like Bitcoin's Bitcoin.org, or like SiaCoin's Sia.Tech to advertise Invisibilis and gain funds. We don't need much funds to fulfill our invisible "business plan". Once it is at the point of development where the coders we have can leave it to the public, without a website, truely invisible.

#How will people download, learn about, and use Invisibilis safely without worry of losing their funds?

With our calculations (yes, I know that sounds clich√©), we've learned that you cannot have a truely anonymous or Invisible coin unless everything about it is invisible.

We have, however, decided that because of the way the world works, you need a spark to light a fire. By spark the fire, we mean allow people that cannot mine  For this reason, we came up with a great idea. Here it is:
